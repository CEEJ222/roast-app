# DTR (Development Time Ratio) Integration Guide

## Overview

This guide documents the comprehensive DTR (Development Time Ratio) integration into your AI roast chat RAG system. DTR is one of the most critical metrics for roast quality, and this integration provides intelligent, machine-aware coaching based on DTR optimization.

## What is DTR?

**Development Time Ratio (DTR)** is the percentage of total roast time spent in the development phase (from first crack to drop). It's calculated as:

```
DTR = (Development Time / Total Roast Time) Ã— 100%
```

DTR directly impacts flavor development:
- **Too Low DTR**: Underdeveloped, grassy, baked flavors
- **Optimal DTR**: Balanced acidity, sweetness, body
- **Too High DTR**: Overdeveloped, burnt, flat flavors

## DTR Targets by Roast Level

| Roast Level | DTR Target Range | Drop Temperature | Development Time |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| **City** | 15-18% | 400-410Â°F | 1.5-2.5 min |
| **City+** | 17-20% | 405-415Â°F | 2.0-3.0 min |
| **Full City** | 20-25% | 415-425Â°F | 2.5-3.5 min |
| **Full City+** | 22-28% | 420-430Â°F | 3.0-4.0 min |

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic DTR Analysis

```python
from dtr_knowledge import dtr_coach

# Get DTR-aware coaching
coaching = dtr_coach.get_dtr_aware_coaching(
    roast_level="City+",
    current_phase="development",
    elapsed_time=720,  # 12 minutes
    first_crack_time=600,  # 10 minutes
    current_temp=410.0,
    ror=8.0
)

print(f"DTR Status: {coaching['dtr_status']}")
print(f"Current DTR: {coaching['current_dtr']}%")
print(f"Coaching: {coaching['coaching']}")
```

### 2. Machine-Specific DTR Advice

```python
from machine_profiles import FreshRoastMachineProfiles

machine_profiles = FreshRoastMachineProfiles()
profile = machine_profiles.get_profile("SR800", True)  # SR800 with extension

# Get DTR-aware development advice
advice = machine_profiles.get_dtr_aware_development_advice(
    profile=profile,
    roast_level="Full City",
    current_dtr=22.5,
    current_heat=5,
    current_fan=7,
    current_temp=420.0,
    ror=10.0
)

print(f"DTR Status: {advice['dtr_status']}")
print(f"Coaching: {advice['coaching_message']}")
```

### 3. API Endpoint Usage

```javascript
// Get DTR-aware coaching during roast
const response = await fetch('/api/rag/during-roast-advice', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    roast_progress: {
      roast_level: "City+",
      machine_info: { model: "SR800", has_extension: true },
      events: [{ event_type: "first_crack", t_offset_sec: 600 }],
      elapsed_time: 720,
      current_temp: 410.0,
      current_heat: 5,
      current_fan: 7,
      ror: 8.0
    },
    user_question: "How is my DTR looking?"
  })
});

const data = await response.json();
console.log(data.advice); // DTR-aware coaching response
```

## DTR Coaching Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Underdeveloped Roast (DTR Too Low)

**Example:** City roast with 12% DTR (target: 15-18%)

**AI Response:**
```
ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: DTR 12.0% is 3.0% below target for City. 
FreshRoast SR800 needs more development time. 
Increase heat if temperature is low, or extend development time.
```

**Machine-Specific Guidance:**
- SR800: Increase heat by 1-2 levels if temp < 400Â°F
- SR800+ET: More forgiving, can maintain heat at 6-7
- Monitor for light brown color change
- Watch for first crack completion

### Scenario 2: Overdeveloped Roast (DTR Too High)

**Example:** Full City roast with 30% DTR (target: 20-25%)

**AI Response:**
```
ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: DTR 30.0% is 5.0% above target. 
FreshRoast SR800 roast is overdeveloped. 
Drop immediately to prevent over-roasting.
```

**Machine-Specific Guidance:**
- SR800: Drop immediately, reduce heat by 2 levels
- SR800+ET: Still drop, but extension provides some protection
- Watch for oil development and dark color
- Consider cooling method

### Scenario 3: Optimal DTR

**Example:** City+ roast with 18.5% DTR (target: 17-20%)

**AI Response:**
```
ðŸŽ¯ Perfect! DTR 18.5% is on target for City+. 
FreshRoast SR800 is performing well. 
Continue monitoring development.
```

**Machine-Specific Guidance:**
- Maintain current heat/fan settings
- Continue watching for color development
- Prepare for drop at target temperature
- Monitor for any temperature spikes
