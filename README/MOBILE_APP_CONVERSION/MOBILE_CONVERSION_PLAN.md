# FreshRoast CoPilot - Mobile App Conversion Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the complete plan to convert the FreshRoast CoPilot web application into native mobile apps for iOS and Android using Capacitor.

## Important Note
**NO GIT COMMITS UNTIL EXPLICITLY REQUESTED** - All development work will be done locally until the user explicitly asks for git commits.

## Project Status
- **Current State**: Responsive web app with mobile-friendly design
- **Target**: Native iOS and Android apps
- **Approach**: Capacitor hybrid app (recommended for mobile-ready web apps)
- **Timeline**: 4-6 weeks total
- **Code Reuse**: ~90% of existing code

## Architecture Decision
**Capacitor** was chosen over React Native because:
- ✅ App is already mobile-responsive with Tailwind CSS
- ✅ Minimal code changes required
- ✅ Faster development timeline (4-6 weeks vs 4-6 months)
- ✅ Maintains existing tech stack (React, Vite, Tailwind)
- ✅ Full access to native features

## Conversion Phases

### Phase 1: Setup & Foundation (Week 1)
- Capacitor installation and configuration
- Mobile development environment setup
- Basic mobile testing setup

### Phase 2: Core Mobile Features (Week 2-3)
- Native device integration (camera, notifications)
- Offline data synchronization
- Background processing for roast timers

### Phase 3: Enhanced Mobile Experience (Week 4)
- Mobile-specific UI optimizations
- Performance optimizations
- Advanced native features

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment (Week 5-6)
- Comprehensive testing on devices
- App store preparation
- Submission and deployment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] iOS app builds and runs successfully
- [ ] Android app builds and runs successfully
- [ ] All existing web features work on mobile
- [ ] Native features (camera, notifications) functional
- [ ] Offline mode working
- [ ] App store ready for submission

## Risk Mitigation
- Keep existing web app running throughout development
- Test on real devices early and often
- Maintain backup of working web version
- Incremental development with frequent testing

## Documentation Structure
Each phase has its own detailed document:
- `MOBILE_PHASE_1_SETUP.md` - Setup and foundation
- `MOBILE_PHASE_2_CORE_FEATURES.md` - Core mobile features
- `MOBILE_PHASE_3_ENHANCED_EXPERIENCE.md` - Enhanced mobile experience
- `MOBILE_PHASE_4_TESTING_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Testing and deployment

## Next Steps
1. Review this plan
2. Begin Phase 1 setup
3. Follow phase-specific documentation
4. Test incrementally throughout development
