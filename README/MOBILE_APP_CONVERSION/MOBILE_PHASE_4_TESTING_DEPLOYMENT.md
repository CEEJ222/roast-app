import { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.roastbuddy.app',
  appName: 'Roast Buddy',
  webDir: 'dist',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https'
  },
  plugins: {
    Camera: {
      permissions: ['camera']
    },
    PushNotifications: {
      presentationOptions: ["badge", "sound", "alert"]

      enabled: true
    }
  },
  ios: {
    scheme: 'Roast Buddy',
    contentInset: 'automatic'
  },
  android: {
    allowMixedContent: true,
    captureInput: true,
    webContentsDebuggingEnabled: false
  }
};

export default config;
```

#### Code Signing Setup

# Update android/app/build.gradle
android {
    signingConfigs {
        release {
            keyAlias 'roast-buddy'
            keyPassword 'your-key-password'
