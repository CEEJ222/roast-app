# Alternative CORS Solution: Proxy Approach

If Railway continues to have CORS issues, here are alternative solutions:

## Option 1: Deploy Backend to Vercel (Recommended)

Vercel has excellent CORS support and is more reliable for FastAPI applications.

### Steps:
1. Create a new Vercel project
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set output directory: `backend`
5. Add environment variables from Railway
6. Deploy

### Vercel Configuration (vercel.json):
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "backend/main.py",
      "use": "@vercel/python"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "backend/main.py"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Option 2: Use Railway's Built-in CORS (if available)

Check Railway dashboard for CORS settings in the service configuration.

## Option 3: Frontend Proxy Solution

Add a proxy configuration to your Vite frontend to avoid CORS entirely:

### vite.config.js:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'https://roast-backend-production-8883.up.railway.app',
        changeOrigin: true,
        rewrite: (path) => path.replace(/^\/api/, '')
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Then update your frontend API calls to use `/api` instead of the full Railway URL.

## Option 4: Deploy to Render

Render has better CORS support than Railway:

1. Create account at render.com
2. Connect GitHub repository
3. Create new Web Service
4. Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Set start command: `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT`
6. Add environment variables
7. Deploy

## Current Status

The simplified CORS approach has been deployed to Railway. If it still fails, I recommend moving to Vercel or Render for better reliability.
