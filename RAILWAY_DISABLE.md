# URGENT: Disable Railway Completely

## Manual Steps to Stop Railway:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Find your `roast-backend` project**
3. **Go to Settings → Source**
4. **Click "Disconnect" or "Remove GitHub Integration"**
5. **OR Delete the entire Railway project**

## Alternative: Delete Railway Project
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Go to Settings → Danger Zone
3. Click "Delete Project"

## Why Railway is Still Building:
- Railway might have cached the connection
- The `.railwayignore` file might not be enough
- Railway might be using a different branch or configuration

## Next Steps:
1. **Manually disconnect Railway from GitHub**
2. **Delete the Railway project entirely**
3. **Focus only on Vercel deployment**
4. **Test Vercel backend once Railway is completely stopped**

This will stop the confusion and focus on getting Vercel working properly.
